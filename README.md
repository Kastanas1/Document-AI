# Document-AI
The repository provided contains the source code corresponding to my thesis project entitled 'Document AI: A Comparative Study of Transformer-Based, Graph-Based Models, and Convolutional Neural Networks for
Document Layout Analysis'
Here you can find the PDF

We make the code available for all the experiments through jupyter notebooks. 

# Document Layout Analysis as Image-Centric task
Experiments with LayoutLMv3, YOLOv5 on DocLayNet and GROTOAP2 (first-pages) datasets.

The preprocessing steps to convert XML from GROTOAP2 to COCO format are here CONVERT XML TO COCO.ipynb

One can reproduce the experiment with LayoutLMv3 on DocLayNet dataset using LayoutLMv3_DocLayNet.ipynb   

One can reproduce the experiment with LayoutLMv3 on GROTOAP2 dataset using LayoutLMv3_GROTOAP2.ipynb

One can reproduce the experiment with YOLOv5 on GROTOAP2 dataset here YOLOv5 on GROTOAP2.ipynb

# Document Layout Analysis as Text-Centric task

One can reproduce the experiment with LayoutLMv3 on GROTOAP dataset using token_class_layoutlmv3_grotoap2.ipynb

One can reproduce the experiment with Paragraph2Graph on GROTOAP dataset using ...

# Document Layout Analysis with LiLT

One can reproduce the experiment with LiLT on GROTOAP2 dataset using LILT_GROTOAP2.ipynb
