# Document-AI
The repository provided contains the source code corresponding to my thesis project entitled 'Document AI: A Comparative Study of Transformer-Based, Graph-Based Models, and Convolutional Neural Networks for
Document Layout Analysis'
Here you can find the PDF

We make the code available for all the experiments through jupyter notebooks.
